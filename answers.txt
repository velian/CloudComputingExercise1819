CPU Benchmarks

1. Linpack Sh merely compiles and executes linpack and provides an output. Linpack.sh calculates the kflops based on the time the machine requires to solve a 1000x1000 array as a system of linear ecuations

2. Linpack measures FLOPS or floating point operations per second. I would expect Linpack Benchmarks run on paravirtualized hardware to run faster than other emulation methods. This is because Paravirtualization allows for better hardware performance.

3. Reasons: Heavy load on target servers, no paravirtualization, they shut us off.

Memory benchmark

1. Memsweep works by measuring the time it takes for the machine to access and make changes to a very large array. Size is 8096 * 4096, size*10 changes are made, changes are made based on contents of array so it is accessed 2 times per change.

Disk Benchmark

1. Data moved from one plaece to another (Different underlying generations of hardware)
