CPU Benchmarks

1. Linpack Sh merely compiles and executes linpack and provides an output. Linpack.sh calculates the kflops based on the time the machine requires to solve a 1000x1000 array as a system of linear ecuations

2. Linpack measures FLOPS or floating point operations per second. I woudl not expect paravirtualization to affect Linpack as no privileged instructions are run.

3. Reasons: Heavy load on target servers, no paravirtualization, they shut us off.

Memory benchmark

1. Memsweep works by measuring the time it takes for the machine to access and make changes to a very large array. Size is 8096 * 4096, size*10 changes are made, changes are made based on contents of array so it is accessed 2 times per change. I expect virtualization to affect memsweep as accessing memory has to be indirected.

Disk Benchmark

1. Data moved from one place to another (Different underlying generations of hardware)
